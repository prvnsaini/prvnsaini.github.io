# Creating Bugs is my skill and fixing them is my hobby !!


I am a multidisciplinary Solutions Architect with over 13+ years of IT experience in providing leadership, solutions, and cultivated transformation ideas across domains.

My experience is ranging from technology strategy and architecture to hands-on implementation, most recently in Cloud, Big Data, and state-of-the-art application architecture. 
I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best.
